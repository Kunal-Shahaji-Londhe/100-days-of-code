# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 07, 2024 


**Today's Progress**: coded a password generator in react and tailwind css with help of hitesh choudhary's youtube video.

**Thoughts:** i know the basics of html css and some basic react therefore directly jumped to hooks part i have basic understanding of react but want to be better at it. hitesh's video was about useState , useRef and useEffect. understood the concept really well.
